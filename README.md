# Checkers

The classic game of Checkers (a.k.a. draughts).

# About

This program provides a gui with which you can play checkers against the computer or another player. I used Python's Turtle library to draw the gui.
I did my best to follow SOLID design principles when implementing the game. This involved encapsulating different functionalities such as the
board (model), gui (view), and input/move processor (controller) inside of distinct classes.

Feel free to read more about the game here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkers. The history of the game is actually super fascinating!
